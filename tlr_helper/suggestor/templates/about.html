    <p>
      <strong>TLR Helper</strong> is a tool designed by <em>TEDD Ghana</em> and <em>NileEdge Innovations</em>
      to support teachers in developing <strong>curriculum-aligned Teaching-Learning Resources</strong> (TLRs)
      for the Ghana Standards-Based Curriculum (SBC).
    </p>

    <p>
      You can search for TLRs based on class level, subject, strand, competency, or learning theme. Each TLR
      includes guidance on materials, steps, tips, and classroom context â€” making it easier to bring creative,
      hands-on learning to life.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe in empowering teachers to adapt to their classroom needs, learning styles, and special needs,
      while still delivering outcomes aligned with national standards.
